# Meteo by Pozytywne3D

The meteo application using the proprietary API, which downloads data from proprietary meteorological stations.


## Description

The main pillar of the project is the construction of three weather stations testing the level of air pollution, humidity, temperature and atmospheric pressure, as well as creating a website presenting the results read. We will use the skills acquired during our classes and individual knowledge in electronics, programming and 3D printing.
